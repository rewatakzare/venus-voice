  introduction: [
    "“I Understand English, But I Can’t Speak It”",
    "This is one of the most common sentences spoken by English learners across ages and professions.",
    "You may understand movies, read English articles, and even write exams well, yet when it comes to speaking, words freeze, sentences break, and confidence disappears.",
    "This gap between knowing English and speaking English fluently is not a personal failure. It is a learning gap, and it can be fixed.",
    "Spoken English feels difficult not because learners lack intelligence or effort, but because most have not been trained for real communication.",
    "This article explores why spoken English remains a challenge and offers practical, realistic solutions to build fluency and confidence.",
