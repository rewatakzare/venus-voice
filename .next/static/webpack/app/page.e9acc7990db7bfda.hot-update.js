He believed deeply in the power of education, especially for women, and often said that education is the key to a bright and fulfilling future. His thoughts were always centered on creating opportunities for learning. He worked tirelessly to counsel parents who hesitated to educate their daughters, convincing them of the importance of education. Through his efforts, many young girls were able to pursue their studies and transform their lives. As I embark on this journey of building my company, I carry forward his vision of empowering individuals through knowledge and education. Our goal is to provide opportunities that transform lives, just as my father envisioned. To all those who share the belief in the transformative power of education, this mission is for you too. Together, we can create a brighter future, one empowered mind at a time. Thank you for taking the time to understand the inspiration behind this mission.
